        automatically in this browser version.</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Players play in turns.</li>

      <li>If a cell gets full, the last player to place a token in the cell gets all the tokens from said cell.</li>
      <li>If a 7 is rolled, a token is added to the <i>puchero</i>.</li>
      <li>If a 12 is rolled, the player gets all the tokens inside the <i>puchero</i>.</li>
      <li>If a player hasn't got any more tokens to place, they get all the tokens remaining in the cell.</li>
      <li>If all players haven't got any more tokens to place, the first player to roll a 12 gets all the remaining
        tokens in the board, including the <i>puchero</i>.</li>
